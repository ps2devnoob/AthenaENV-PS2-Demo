# Demonstration – AthenaEnv

👋 **Welcome to a small demonstration showing just a fraction of AthenaEnv’s power!**

This project is **not a huge or ambitious game** — it’s simply a **technical example** meant to showcase what **AthenaEnv** can do on the PlayStation 2.
Even though it’s a small demo, it already highlights the **rendering, animation, and performance capabilities** of the engine.

## 🧩 About this project

1. **Not a big project**
   This is just a **showcase of AthenaEnv’s potential**, not a full game.
   It serves as a **technical sample**, demonstrating how the environment handles complex 3D models and scenes.

2. **Using Ellie (Remake) character model**
   This demo uses the **Ellie character model from the remake**, **without any optimizations** — it keeps the **same polygon count as the original model**.
   ⚠️ This is **not recommended** for the PlayStation 2, since the console **can’t display that level of detail efficiently**.
   The goal here is simply to show that AthenaEnv can **load and render** such complex assets.

3. **Light baked map**
   The map in this demo uses **baked lighting** — the lighting was **pre-calculated** and baked into the textures.
   It’s **not real-time lighting** from the engine. This approach was chosen to **save processing power** and maintain better performance on PS2.

## ⚙️ Technologies used

* **AthenaEnv** (JavaScript-based development environment for PS2)
* Rendering through **RenderData + Screen.display()**
* Support for **complex 3D models** and **skeletal animations**
* Use of **baked light textures** for performance optimization

## 🎮 Purpose

The goal of this demo is to showcase **AthenaEnv’s capability** to handle high-complexity 3D content, even on limited hardware — proving it can be used both for **technical experiments** and **creative projects** on the PlayStation 2.
